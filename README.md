# Members Only

Main focus for this was to learn about creating and authenticating users and giving users different abilities and permissions

Description: A website that anyone can sign up to make posts. Users posts remain anonymous unless the user signs up to be a "member". After becoming a member, your username will show up on your posts, and other members usernames will show up on theirs. Users that are not members will still be anonymous.

Site uses all CRUD methods for posting. 

Site was written using Nodejs with Express for the backend and MongoDB/Mongoose for the database.
